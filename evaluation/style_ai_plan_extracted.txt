guidance
 
while
 
considering
 
skin
 
tone,

preferences,
 
and
 
current
 
fashion
 
trends.
 
Scenarios  
Scenario  1:  Skin  Tone  Analysis  &  Initial  Styling  A  user  uploads  a  clear  facial  photograph  to  
StyleAI.
 
The
 
system
 
detects
 
their
 
skin
 
tone
 
category
 
(Fair,
 
Medium,
 
Olive,
 
Deep),
 
analyzes
 
the
 
facial
 
region
 
for
 
accurate
 
color
 
detection,
 
and
 
provides
 
initial
 
personalized
 
styling
 
recommendations.
 
The
 
AI
 
suggests
 
color
 
palettes,
 
outfit
 
combinations,
 
and
 
accessories
 
that
 
complement
 
their
 
specific
 
skin
 
tone.
 
Scenario  2:  Gender-Specific  Fashion  Recommendations  A  female  user  uploads  her  photo  and  
indicates
 
her
 
gender
 
preference.
 
StyleAI
 
generates
 
tailored
 
recommendations
 
including:
 
●  Suitable  dress  codes  (Formal,  Business,  Casual,  Party)  ●  Gender-specific  outfit  descriptions  with  tops,  bottoms,  and  shoes  ●  Hairstyle  suggestions  with  maintenance  tips  ●  Accessory  recommendations  (earrings,  necklaces,  bracelets,  watches)  ●  Color  palette  guidance  (primary,  secondary,  accent  colors)  ●  Detailed  explanation  of  why  recommendations  work  for  her  skin  tone  
Scenario  3:  Curated  Shopping  Experience  After  receiving  styling  recommendations,  the  user  
accesses
 
curated
 
product
 
links
 
from
 
major
 
Indian
 
retailers
 
(Amazon.in,
 
Myntra,
 
Zara).
 
Products
 
are
 
specifically
 
selected
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
user's
 
skin
 
tone
 
and
 
gender,
 
including
 
direct
 
shopping
 
links
 
for
 
shirts,
 
pants,
 
shoes,
 
and
 
accessories
 
from
 
verified
 
e-commerce
 
platforms
